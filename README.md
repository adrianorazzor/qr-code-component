## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I used what they call "CSS reset", changing the box-sizing model to border box and applying margin 0 to the page's elements.
The main thing that I used is the flexbox, which is something that I just learned and i'm trying to get good at.

```css
.*,
*::before,
*::after
{
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

body,
h1,
h2,
h3,
p {
    margin: 0;
}
}
```

### Continued development

My focus now is to keep practicing the flebox, which is one thing I'm struggling a little bit.
